# Creating custom components

## üìù Your Notes

React must be in scope when using JSX, since it compiles into React.createElement(...)

The component you're referencing must, of course, be in scope as well.

User-defined components MUST be capitalized.

You can't use an expression as a JSX type, so you need to assign it to a (capitalized) variable FIRST.

```
const components = {   
photo: PhotoStory,   
video: VideoStory 
};
const SpecificStory = components[props.storyType];   
return <SpecificStory story={props.story} />;
```

When you pass a string literal, its value is HTML-unescaped. So these two JSX expressions are equivalent:

```
<MyComponent message="&lt;3" />

<MyComponent message={'<3'} />
```

The following usage, passing a FUNCTION to props.children, is not common, but works:
```
// Calls the children callback numTimes to produce a repeated component
function Repeat(props) {
  let items = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < props.numTimes; i++) {
      items.push(props.children(i));
  }
  return <div>{items}</div>;
}

function ListOfTenThings() {
  return (
    <Repeat numTimes={10}>
        {(index) => <div key={index}>This is item {index} in the list</div>}
    </Repeat>
  );
}
```

** JSX does not render booleans, null or undefined when passed as children -- that is why we can conditionally render React elements.
The following all render the same thing:
```
<div />

<div></div>

<div>{false}</div>

<div>{null}</div>

<div>{undefined}</div>

<div>{true}</div>
```


That's why you can do this:
```
let showHeader = false;
<div>
{showHeader && <Header />}
<Content />
</div>
```
That being said, some 'falsy' values like 0 will still be rendered, so be careful. The following will render 0 when props.messages.length is 0:
```
<div>   
  {props.messages.length &&     
    <MessageList messages={props.messages} />   
  } 
</div>
```

This can be avoided by making it a boolean:
```
<div>   
  {props.messages.length > 0 &&     
    <MessageList messages={props.messages} />   
  } 
</div>
```

If you WANT to see a falsey value, convert it to a string:
```
<div>   My JavaScript variable is {String(myVariable)}. </div>
```

*** You can override the spread operator!***
```
const className = 'container';
const props = {className};
const element = <div {...props} className="not-container" />
```

propTypes is just a property on your components, and you pass it an object of property names mapped to functions that return an error based upon a condition of your choice. OR, you include the prop-types package and use its prewritten validators. 
for performance reasons, propTypes is only checked in development mode

Aside from JS types, you can also set a prop type equal to: node, element, elementType (i.e. MyComponent), instanceOf a class, .oneOf(['News', 'Photos']), .oneOfType, .arrayOf certain type, .objectOf values of a certain type, .shape, .exact, .isRequired, any.isRequired, custom validator that must return an Error object if validation fails, or a custom validator to arrayOf or objectOf

To use proptypes with a function component, you need to define it, add proptypes, THEN export it (kinda obvious but worth pointing out)

**Fragments**
React Fragments solve the problem of, for example, grouping table rows without a div:
```
class Table extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <table>
        <tr>
        <Columns />
        </tr>
      </table>
    );
  }
}

// THIS IS INVALID:
class Columns extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <td>Hello</td>
        <td>World</td>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

If you use the explicit React.Fragment form, you can have keys:
```
function Glossary(props) {
  return (
      <dl>
        {props.items.map(item => (
          // Without the `key`, React will fire a key warning
          <React.Fragment key={item.id}>
            <dt>{item.term}</dt>
            <dd>{item.description}</dd>
          </React.Fragment>
        ))}
      </dl>
  );
}
```



## Background

Just like in regular JavaScript, you often want to share code which you do using
functions. If you want to share JSX, you can do that as well. In React we call
these functions "components" and they have some special properties.

Components are basically functions which return something that is "renderable"
(more React elements, strings, `null`, numbers, etc.)

## Exercise

Production deploys:

- [Exercise](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/exercise/04.html)
- [Final](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/final/04.html)

Let's say the DOM we want to generate is like this:

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="message">Hello World</div>
  <div class="message">Goodbye World</div>
</div>
```

In this case, it would be cool if we could reduce the duplication for creating
the React elements for this:

```jsx
<div className="message">{children}</div>
```

So we need to make a function which accepts an object argument with a `children`
property and returns the React element. Then you can interpolate a call to that
function in your JSX.

```jsx
<div>{message({children: 'Hello World'})}</div>
```

This is not how we write custom React components, but this is important for you
to understand them. We'll get to custom components in the extra credit.

## Extra Credit

### 1. üíØ using a custom component with React.createElement

[Production deploy](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/final/04.extra-1.html)

So far we've only used `React.createElement(someString)`, but the first argument
to `React.createElement` can also be a function which returns something that's
renderable.

So instead of calling your `message` function, pass it as the first argument to
`React.createElement` and pass the `{children: 'Hello World'}` object as the
second argument.

### 2. üíØ using a custom component with JSX

[Production deploy](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/final/04.extra-2.html)

We're so close! Just like using JSX for regular `div`s is nicer than using the
raw `React.createElement` API, using JSX for custom components is nicer too.
Remember that it's Babel that's responsible for taking our JSX and compiling it
to `React.createElement` calls so we just need a way to tell Babel how to
compile our JSX so it passes the function by its name rather than a string.

We do this by how the JSX appears. Here are a few examples of Babel output for
JSX:

```javascript
ui = <Capitalized /> // React.createElement(Capitalized)
ui = <property.access /> // React.createElement(property.access)
ui = <Property.Access /> // React.createElement(Property.Access)
ui = <Property['Access'] /> // SyntaxError
ui = <lowercase /> // React.createElement('lowercase')
ui = <kebab-case /> // React.createElement('kebab-case')
ui = <Upper-Kebab-Case /> // React.createElement('Upper-Kebab-Case')
ui = <Upper_Snake_Case /> // React.createElement(Upper_Snake_Case)
ui = <lower_snake_case /> // React.createElement('lower_snake_case')
```

See if you can change your component function name so people can use it with JSX
more easily!

### 3. üíØ Runtime validation with PropTypes

[Production deploy](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/final/04.extra-3.html)

Let's change the Message component a little bit. Make it look like this now:

```javascript
function Message({subject, greeting}) {
  return (
    <div className="message">
      {greeting}, {subject}
    </div>
  )
}
```

So now we'll use it like this:

```javascript
<Message greeting="Hello" subject="World" />
<Message greeting="Goodbye" subject="World" />
```

What happens if I forget to pass the `greeting` or `subject` props? It's not
going to render properly. We'll end up with a dangling comma somewhere. It would
be nice if we got some sort of indication that we passed the wrong value to the
component. This is what the `propTypes` feature is for. Here's an example of how
you use `propTypes`:

```javascript
function FavoriteNumber({favoriteNumber}) {
  return <div>My favorite number is: {favoriteNumber}</div>
}

const PropTypes = {
  number(props, propName, componentName) {
    if (typeof props[propName] !== 'number') {
      return new Error('Some useful error message here')
    }
  },
}

FavoriteNumber.propTypes = {
  favoriteNumber: PropTypes.number,
}
```

With that, if I do this:

```javascript
<FavoriteNumber favoriteNumber="not a number" />
```

I'll get an error in the console.

For this extra credit, add `propTypes` support to your updated component
(remember to update it to have the subject and greeting).

ü¶â Note that prop types add some runtime overhead resulting in sub-optimal
performance, so they are not run in production.

### 4. üíØ Use the prop-types package

[Production deploy](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/final/04.extra-4.html)

As it turns out, there are some pretty common things you'd want to validate, so
the React team maintains a package of these called
[`prop-types`](https://npm.im/prop-types). Go ahead and get that added to the
page by adding a script tag for it:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/prop-types@15.7.2/prop-types.js"></script>
```

Then use that package instead of writing it yourself. Also, make use of the
`isRequired` feature!

### 5. üíØ using React Fragments

[Production deploy](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/final/04.extra-5.html)

One feature of JSX that you'll find useful is called
["React Fragments"](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html). It's a special
kind of component from React which allows you to position two elements
side-by-side rather than just nested.

The component is available via `<React.Fragment>` (or a
[short syntax](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html#short-syntax) that opens
with `<>` and closes with `</>`). Replace the `<div className="container">` with
a fragment and inspect the DOM to notice that the elements are both rendered as
direct children of `root`.
